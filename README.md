# megabasterd-docker

A containerized app for megbasterd from https://github.com/tonikelope/megabasterd

This is an alpine container with noVNC which enables the running app GUI (Megabasterd) to be accessed from a web browser. I used the base image from https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui and configured it to run Megabasterd.

## Setup
### Step 1: Setting up the docker container
I recommend using docker-compose, a typical script for that would look like:
```
version: '3'
services:
  megabasterd:
    image: gauravsuman007/megabasterd
    ports:
      - "5800:5800"
    volumes:
      - "./config:/config:rw"
      - "./output:/output:rw"
```

Here the folder `./output` refers to the location where the files will be downloaded on the disk, feel free to modify it as per your needs(This needs to be configured, see step 2)
You can also choose to move the `./config` folder to another location but it's not neccessary.

Alternatively, you can always clone the repo and build your own image using the provided Dockerfile.

### Step 2: Accessing the app and configuring it
The web UI can be accessed at port `5800`.
On the first run, go to the top menu "Edit" -> "Settings", here you should configure the following items:
- Download folder to point it to /output

- MEGA API key (Under Advanced)

- (Optional) Use Smartproxy.

## Downloading
The copy paste doesn't work as you would expect in the GUI. To paste a mega link, you first need to open the app clipboard from the top bar and paste your links there. Then you can go to "File" -> "New download" and the links pasted in the clipboard will be accessed automatically.

## Updating the megabasterd app
Since Megabasterd updates very frequently I don't plan to provide a lot of updates unless there are breaking changes or I find the time to push out a new update. To manually up√ºdate to the latest Megabasterd release, download the latest Linux version of their java package, unzip it and copy the MegaBasterd.jar from the jar folder to /config/MegaBasterd/jar/ (replacing the existing file). Restart the container and the new version should be loaded!
